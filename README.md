# FaceAccess Client - Face Recognition based Access Management System Client App

As the name suggests this is a client side app to interface with the FaceAccess Server for face-recognition 
based access authentication system.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to setup and run this project on your system.

### Prerequisites

This project needs the following packages to be installed to run.

```
1) Gradle Build System (5.4.1)
2) Android SDK (API 21)
```

And you need either a AVD or a physical android device of API 21 and above to run this project on.

### Installing and Running

I strongly suggest to use Android Studio for running this project as it's a pretty good IDE for Android
Development. Also It takes care of most of the dependency installation by itself with minimal user
interaction.
